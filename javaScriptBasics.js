//7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
// variables can be declared with let or const; let = mutable variable, const = set variable.
// can access properties and methods by using theÂ ., dot operator.

/* Arithmetic Operators 

    Add: +
    Subtract: -
    Multiply: *
    Divide: /
    Remainder: %

    if perfomring arithmetic operation on the same variable can shorten using this method *=, /=, +=, -=
    ex. 
    var1 = var1 + 2; 
    can be shortened to 
    var1 += 2;

    This allows you to perform arithmetic in your code
*/
  
console.log(3 + 7) //prints 10 to oonsole
console.log(5 - 2) //prints 3 to console

/*String Concatenation 
You can also add strings. 

can use string interpolation for easier method, must use back ticks `` instead of quotes and ${} to insert variable
ex. 
console.log(`this is an example ${variable1}`);

*/


console.log('Hello' + 'World') // prints helloworld 
console.log('Hello' + ' World') // prints hello world. Spacing must me manually added to your strings within quotes.

/* Properies of strings and the dot operator .
every string has a proper called length we can retreive this data using the dot operator 
*/
console.log('string'.length); // Prints 5 the length of the word string

/*String methods
We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

    a period (the dot operator)
    the name of the method
    opening and closing parentheses

E.g. 'example string'.methodName(). */

/* conditionals 
  if statements are a type of conditional statement that runs if the condition is true
the layout is
if (condtion){
    block of code
}
if the condition returns as false the block of code is not executed

/* alternatively there is also what is known as an if else statment
it is similar to an else statement, except in this scenario if the original condition evaluates to false
then it moves on to the next block of code and checks if it has a second condition, if none is provided then 
it automatically runs
example below
